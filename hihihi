Hello World
bye bye babe

i am so hugry :(
do you want pizza???

Now gotta step on it, what else can I do?
I'm young and fearless, man
Middle finger up, F-U pay me
90's baby, I pump up the jam
Step on it, step on it, oppa-ya lambo
Today yours and mine, our youth's a gamble
Don't dare to stop me, if anyone gets in my way
I'ma go, brrrr, Rambo
