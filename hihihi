Hello World, how are you?
bye bye babe
are you beartiful loco

ня ня ня
мур мур мур
ыыыы

hit you wheather ddu-du-ddu-du



Click-Clack, badda bing badda booom
All eyes on me when I bust down the door
Without even trying
All the guys get nosebleeds like pangpangpang
Pangpang, parapara, pangpangpang
Now everybody cheers for me, clink clink clink
Hands up! Holding a bottle full o' Henny
The girl you've been hearing about, that's me, Kseni
