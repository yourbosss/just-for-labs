Hello World
bye bye babe

i am so hugry :(
do you want pizza???

Now gotta step on it, what else can I do?
I'm young and fearless, man
Middle finger up, F-U pay me
90's baby, I pump up the jam
Step on it, step on it, oppa-ya lambo
Today yours and mine, our youth's a gamble
Don't dare to stop me, if anyone gets in my way
I'ma go, brrrr, Rambo

Hello World, how are you?

ня ня ня
мур мур мур

hit you wheather ddu-du-ddu-du



Click-Clack, badda bing badda booom
All eyes on me when I bust down the door
Without even trying
All the guys get nosebleeds like pangpangpang
Pangpang, parapara, pangpangpang
Now everybody cheers for me, clink clink clink
Hands up! Holding a bottle full o' Henny
The girl you've been hearing about, that's me, Kseni
